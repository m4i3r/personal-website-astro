				Hi! I'm Manuel, {age} years old and from Bavaria, Germany.
				Currently I'm abroad as a exchange student living in Dublin, Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª.
				I'm a final-year student of Business Information Systems (often aka Management Information Systems)
				at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Rosenheim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides my studies I work part-times as a Working Student in Software Development where my focus lies in
				developing web applications.
				Through this role I'm exposed to JavaScript, Java, GraphQL, Springboot, TypeScript, NodeJS, Docker and
				many more.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a great interest of mine lies in Cloud Infrastructure and Networking I'm passionate about my HomeLab.
				HomeLabbing basically means building up servers and selfhosting cloud storage/services
				instead of relying on commercial cloud services like Google and Co. Not only am I regaining ownership of
				my data, you learn a TON about how stuff works including Docker/Kubernetes, IP protocols, RESTful-APIs,
				Networking, PC hardware and more.
			</p>
			<img src="/images/homelab.jpeg" title="My Homelab with TrueNas, Proxmox and a Synology DS as Backup." />
			<p>
				I plan on writing up my HomeLab properly in a seperate post that you can read on this site when it's
				done!
			</p>
			<p>
				Last but not least is my passion for photography. What started as a basic interest is now a full-grown
				hobby of mine. I really enjoy taking and editing photos as it can be relaxing to escape in a different
				perspective of things.
				If you're interested in seeing some photos, please follow <a href="/portfolio">along</a>!
