My studies of Business Information Systems at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Rosenheim include a practial training semester. To gather first-hand international experience I decided to complete this internship semester abroad. A destination of choice was found quickly: IrelandðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª!

Arriving in Dublin was exciting, as I only knew small cities before (at max. 75k residents). It was raining, of course, but I was just baffled by a unbeliveably vibrant and beautiful city that is so much different to large german cities. As today is the 20th of September and I arrived here on September 1st, I haven't been here for long. I will update this thread as time goes on, so please stay tuned! :)

It is also the start of this website / blog / portfolio of mine. I never had a Blog before and my photo portfolio was hosted on Adobe Portfolio, a No-Code website builder included in their subscription to Lightroom and Photoshop. Now im using Astro, a blazing-fast JavaScript framework to build my own website combining ease of use and limitless customisability, therefore taking matters into my own hand.
