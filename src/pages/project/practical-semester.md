My studies of Business Information Systems at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Rosenheim include a practial training semester. To gather first-hand international experience I decided to complete this internship semester abroad. A destination of choice was found quickly: IrelandðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª!

Arriving in Dublin was exciting. I had only experienced small cities before, with a maximum of 75k residents. Despite the rain, I was amazed by the vibrancy and beauty of the city, which was so different from large German cities. I completed an internship with a small Irish tech consulting firm for one month and then continued to work for a German startup remotely from Dublin. This was my first experience of working fully remotely and also my first encounter with co-working spaces, which I loved! You can connect with people from various companies while having the space to work fully concentrated on your own tasks. Working remotely as a Software Engineer can be a true blessing. It's much easier to enter the tunnel and lay down 1-2 hours of fully concentrated work, such as finishing a ticket, while also having room for lighter tasks where you allow some disturbance from chat messages or emails. I am convinced that working remotely or at least in a hybrid model will boost productivity throughout a company. Finn, the German startup, has endorsed a full remote policy. For most roles, it is up to you whether you want to come to the office, work from a funded co-working space, or from home. This gives you the freedom to decide. Additionally, remote work has given me more time to experience the beautiful landscape of Ireland. I had an unforgettable experience, which I have well-documented in pictures.

It is also the start of this website / blog / portfolio of mine. I never had a Blog before and my photo portfolio was hosted on Adobe Portfolio, a No-Code website builder included in their subscription to Lightroom and Photoshop. Now im using Astro, a blazing-fast JavaScript framework to build my own website combining ease of use and limitless customisability, therefore taking matters into my own hand.
